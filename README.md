# customer_purchase_propensity

This is an application designed to calculate the likelihood of a customer making a repeat purchase in the upcoming year at the company. It estimates the probability of a customer being a 'returning customer'.

To operate effectively, it requires a training dataset that includes information on the purchasing behavior of various customers (the more, the better) to create the model. This dataset must include information on what happened in the following year, whether the customer made a purchase or not.

Subsequently, you need to input a new dataset detailing customer behavior up until yesterday, and the model will predict how many of them are likely to make a purchase in the coming year starting from today. Additionally, it will provide a series of insights to gain a broader understanding of customer behavior patterns.
